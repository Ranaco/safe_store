# Safe Shop: Grocery at Your Fingertips

Welcome to Safe Shop, your one-stop solution for day-to-day essentials. With our platform, users can conveniently access and purchase exactly what they need for their daily use. We aim to create a robust community connecting shop owners and consumers, fostering a network around our service.

## Objectives

Our primary objectives revolve around promoting the use of cryptocurrency in daily transactions. To ensure the security of every transaction, we implement a multi-signature wallet using Safe, adding an extra layer of security to the blockchain through Arbitrum.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework for building efficient and scalable web applications.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/): A library for creating smooth animations.

### Middlewares

- [Anon Aadhar](https://anonaadhar.com/): Ensuring secure and anonymous Aadhar verification.
- [Safe Wallet](https://safe.global/): Implementing multi-signature wallets for secure transactions.
- [Arbitrum](https://offchainlabs.com/): Leveraging the Arbitrum network for efficient and scalable smart contracts.

### Database

- [Lighthouse](https://lighthouse.storage/): A decentralized, censorship-resistant database.
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/): A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

## Challenges

1. **Safe Integration**: Achieving compatibility and seamless integration with Ethers posed significant challenges.
2. **Arbitrum Implementation**: As a new network, implementing Arbitrum was time-consuming, and selecting the right testnet presented its own challenges.
3. **Map Integration**: Leveraging Leaflet for map integration proved to be more challenging than anticipated.
